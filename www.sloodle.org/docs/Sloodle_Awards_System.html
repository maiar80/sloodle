<p>Welcome to The Sloodle Awards System!  I'm very pleased to announce the immediate availability of a very exciting addon for Sloodle 1.0!  The Sloodle Awards system enables teachers to award students with points, via an interactive scoreboard system.  
Once configured, the Sloodle Awards System Scoreboard will display the names of all students enrolled in your class. The teacher can give points to a student by clicking on the students name. Each scoreboard is also connected to a special "Sloodle Awards" Moodle assignment.
Points awarded then, also can contribute to a students overal marks for the course.  This therefore, gives teachers the ability to grade students while in Second Life via the Sloodle Awards System Scoreboard.

<p>The Sloodle Awards System operates like a bank. Points are submitted as "Credits" and when subtracted, are seen as "Debits", and a students final total is their Sloodle Awards System balance.  Operating in this way, a teacher can easily view the history of all transactions towards a students' total by visiting the Sloodle Awards Activity within moodle itself.  To add points, a teacher simply clicks on the name of a student.  A menu then appears (See right) and the students total can be modified. Once the correct modification is obtained, the teachers presses "Save" and the transaction is processed (Change is saved on Moodle), and the scoreboard is then updated.

<p>Alternatively, the teacher can also updated a students points by visiting the Sloodle Awards activity in Moodle.  Here, they will see a list of all students with avatars who are enrolled in their course.  There, they can update several students at once by simply adding (or subtracting) points to each students total.  When the Update button is pressed,  all transactions are processed (student totals changed).

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Connecting_the_Sloodle_Awards_System_to_a_Sloodle_Award_Assignment.21.21.21"> Connecting the Sloodle Awards System to a Sloodle Award Assignment!!! </span></h2>
<p>Yes it's true!!! The Sloodle Awards System can interact with the Gradebook! Teachers connect the Sloodle Award System to the gradebook by first creating an Award Assignment and then connecting it to the Awards system.  Once connected, any points earned get applied to the students grade for that assignment.
In the picture below, you'll notice that Paul Preibisch (Fire Centaur) has 100%, but in the Sloodle Award System, it show's that he has 410 points.  This is because the max points for this particular configuration of the Sloodle Award System was set at 100 points, therefore Paul Preibisch got 100% for this assignment.  If the max points was set to 1000, then he would still have earned 410 points, but in the gradebook, it would be converted to 41%.  This flexibility of the system was intentionally designed, so that the Sloodle Award System could be connected to gaming, or task based quests where students might earn well over the 1000 points, depending on the teacher's activity.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Addons"> Addons </span></h2>
<p>The Sloodle Award System has been programmed to accept "Addons".  Addon's are programmed objects that interact with the scoreboard directly either adding or subtracting points.  The feature of the Sloodle Award System opens up a wide world of possibilities include task based quests, where students can be instantly rewarded for completing tasks in Second Life, while having their efforts contribute to their final grade.  When combined with the non-sloodle <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Activity_Locking">Activity Locking mod</a>, interesting possibilities could be created.
</p><p>The following addons have been created so far:
