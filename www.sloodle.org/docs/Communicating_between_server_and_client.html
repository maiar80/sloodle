<p>This specification was implemented fully for <a href="Sloodle_Versions.html#Version_0.2" title="Sloodle Versions">Sloodle version 0.2</a>. You can find more information about using it in the <a href="SloodleDevDocs.html" title="SloodleDevDocs" class="mw-redirect">Developer Documentation</a>.
</p><p><br />
</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Requesting_information_from_the_Moodle_server"> Requesting information from the Moodle server </span></h2>
<p>To request information from the Moodle server, send an HTTP request to the relevant Sloodle linker script. 
</p><p>Standard parameters used here are specified in the <a href="Sloodle_variables.html" title="Sloodle variables"> SLOODLE variables</a> page. Others depend on the linker script they are talking to.
</p><p>The best way to construct your response on the server is to use the <a href="Sloodle_PHP_API.html" title="Sloodle PHP API">Sloodle PHP API</a> (particularly look at the <a href="SloodleLSLHandler.html" title="SloodleLSLHandler">SloodleLSLHandler</a> and it's member instance of <a href="SloodleLSLResponse.html" title="SloodleLSLResponse">SloodleLSLResponse</a>).
</p><p>If you just need a list of a single piece of data that doesn't contain pipe characters or new-lines, and you're not doing any error handling, you can just do this:
</p>
<pre>1
first thing
second thing
third thing
</pre>
<p>...but make sure your LSL script wouldn't break if it received something like:
</p>
<pre>1|OK|322,422|AVATAR_LIST|1191894643|1191894681|1234343-dfdfjdksfjdk-2323232|12345|3|2
first thing
second thing
third thing
</pre>
<p>If you're doing more than that, read on...
</p><p>The script should respond with an HTTP response with the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li> The first line is the "status line" for information about the request. (See below)
</li><li> Fields should be separated by pipe characters (|). If you need to use a pipe characters i your content, it should be escaped with a backslash, eg. \|.
</li><li> Items should be separated by UNIX-style new-line characters (\n). If you need to use a UNIX-style new-line characters in your content, it should be escaped with a backslash (\\n). NB as of 2011-06, this isn't implemented much if at all. 
</li><li> Backslashes (\) should be escaped with a backslash (\\) 
</li><li> The response should contain no more than 2048 characters. If you need to send more than 2048 characters to the client, your data should be separated into pages, which will be indicated in the status line. See <a href="Separating_data_into_pages.html" title="Separating data into pages">Separating data into pages</a> for details.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_status_line"> The status line </span></h2>
<p>The status line should contain the following information, in order, separated by pipe characters (|):
</p>
<ul><li> 0 (Required) Result: A positive number for success, a negative number for failure. [NB Up until now I was using "OK" or "ERROR".] These will be clustered by type, eg. -100. to -200 for authentication issues, -200 to -300 for system failures, etc. These codes should be documented on the <a href="Sloodle_status_codes.html" title="Sloodle status codes">Sloodle status codes</a> page. For Sloodle 2 HTTP-in messages, the HTTP-in handling script will relay the message to other scripts with this number will be used in the "number" field of a linked message.
</li><li> 1 (Optional) Description: A generalized status description understandable by both humans and scripts. In the case of an authentication error, this field would read "AUTH". These should also be documented on the <a href="Sloodle_status_codes.html" title="Sloodle status codes">Sloodle status codes</a> page.
</li><li> 2 (Optional) Side-effect status codes: A comma-delimited list of events that occurred in addition to the main function of the script. For example, a user may try to take a quiz, but be automatically registered and enrolled on the course in the process. In this case, we would return the course data as normal, but add success codes for registration and enrollment in this field. (eg. "322,422")
</li><li> 3 (Optional) Request descriptor: This is a piece of text that should be set in the request, allowing the script to tell what kind of request it's getting back. It's set by a request parameter called "sloodlerequestdesc". For example, if it's making a request for a list of avatars for the course, the request might contain "sloodlerequestdesc=AVATAR_LIST" and the response would include "AVATAR_LIST". 
</li><li> 4 (Optional) Request timestamp: A unix timestamp passed by the requesting script showing the time at which the request was made. This should be passed as is back to the requester. (First implemented 2012-09-12)
</li><li> 5 (Optional) Response timestamp: The time the response header was generated (Not implemented as of 2012-09-12)
</li><li> 6 (Optional) User Key: The key of the user concerned, if there is one.
</li><li> 7 (Optional) Tracking Code: A tracking code for the response. 
</li><li> 8 (Optional) Page total: The number of pages across which the data we are trying to transmit has been split. Usually we won't need to do fancy things like this, so it'll be 1.
</li><li> 9 (Optional) Page number: The page number of the current page, starting at 1. Usually we won't need to do fancy things like this, so it'll be 1.
</li><li> 10 (Optional) HTTP-in password: If this is an http-in message, this will be the password that proves we are allowed to talk to the object.
</li><li> 11 (Optional) Expect response: Set this to 1 if a meaningful response to the message is expected. This is used by the http-in handling code, which passes what it hears on with linked messages. For messages that don't expect a response, it will reply immediately with "OK", for messages that do it will hold off and let the code that deals with that specific message do the response.
</li><li> 12 (Optional) Refresh seconds: Used in scripts that poll the server, it tells us how long to wait until we poll it again.
</li><li> 13 (Optional) Object UUID: The UUID of the object the message is intended for. This is used when the rezzer relays messages to other objects, and needs to know which object to relay to.
</li></ul>
<p>To allow for meta-data we realize we need in the future, LSL scripts should ignore any additional fields tacked onto the end of the meta-data line that we hadn't created when we wrote the script.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_data_lines"> The data lines </span></h2>
<p>In case of success, the data lines should contain whatever you want to put in them. You should document what you're putting in them in comments in the PHP linker script.
In the case of an error, they should contain descriptive human-readable error messages.
